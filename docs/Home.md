This is the official documentation of the Trivial Tickets Ticketsystem.
It consists of guides for installing and building the ticket system
and the dedicated command-line tool as well as usage instructions
for the server, the website and the bundled command-line tool.
Furthermore, it contains information about the Mail API and the
definition of the project in scope of the lecture's task (e.g. a
FAQ to the Requirements). Lastly, additional tools and their usage
are documented here.

Most of the features contained in this Wiki are also documented in
the User Manual:

:closed_book: [Ticketsystem User Manual DE](Ticketsystem_User_Manual_DE.pdf).

Note that the User Manual is currently only available in German
language. An English version may follow.
