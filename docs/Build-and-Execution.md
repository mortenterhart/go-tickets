# Build and Execution

## Executing the server

To build the ticket system, you can run the following command from the
repository's root folder:

```bash
go build ./cmd/ticketsystem
```

Make sure to build the executable from the mentioned directory so that
the default paths still apply correctly. Your binary should be located
at `ticketsystem` or `ticketsystem.exe` depending on your operating
system then which can be executed with

```bash
./ticketsystem [options]
```

A more convenient way to start the server is to use the start scripts
in the root directory. Run

```bash
./startServer.sh [options]
```

or `startServer.bat` on Windows systems. The same applies to the
command-line tool (`./startCLI.sh` and `startCLI.bat`). Note that
the start scripts do not require a previous build using `go build`.
See the :book: [Server Usage](Server-Usage.md) page and the
:book: [CLI Usage](CLI-Usage.md) page for a list of valid options.

## Executing the tests

The unit tests for the different components of the server can be executed
with the following command from the root directory:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

Alternatively, a coverage report can be generated by using the script
`coverage_report.sh`. This executes all tests with a coverage analysis
and documents the results in an output report. Learn more about this
procedure on :book: [Generating a Coverage Report](Generating-a-Coverage-Report.md).
