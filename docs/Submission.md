# Submission

**Deadline**: 10th January 2019

## Submission Scope

The following has to be supplied:

* The complete source code including all test cases
* Documentation of the source code: The documentation consists of two parts: The
  first is the documentation of the source code. This is done most appropriately
  in the source code itself. On the other hand from the documentation of the
  architecture. This should be suitable to provide an outsider with an overview
  of the overall project by answering questions such as: "What components does
  the system consist of?" or "How do the components work together? In
  object-oriented projects, for example, a class diagram can be used to display
  the relationships between the classes, but is not sufficient on its own.
* A PDF file containing following should be submitted:
  * Documentation of architecture
  * User documentation
  * Documentation of execution and deployment
  * Each group member completes a short description of his own contribution to
    the project implementation (one page is sufficient).
* The evaluation only considers the source files and the PDF file.
* All source files and the PDF file have to contain the matriculation numbers of
  all group members.

## Evaluation Criteria

The program draft is rated after the following criteria (with descending emphasis):

1. Meeting the requirements
2. Structure and Consistency of the source code
3. Sufficient test coverage of the implemented code (measured with
   `go test -cover`)
4. Meaningfulness of the tests (special cases, edge cases, orthogonality)
5. Quality of comments and documentation
6. Usability of the interfaces (APIs)
7. Optional Features
8. The website's design does not matter as long as it is usable. No complex
   JavaScript/CSS is required.

## Prerequisites

* The submission of the program draft has to take place at the latest on
  **Friday, 10th January 2019** as packed sources with PDF file in ZIP format
  per `pushci`.
* The task is carried out in groups of a maximum of three students.
* There has to be a summary of contributions from each group member to be submitted.
* Each group prepares an individual solution of the task on its own and submits
  it as denoted above.
* The demanded functionality has to be implemented by your own.
* You can take some inspirations from other projects, but in this case you are
  supposed to supply the origin of the idea or the parts of source code inside
  the source files respectively.
